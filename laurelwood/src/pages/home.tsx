			<p>	This year we're celebrating our 25th anniversary and we couldn't have done it without our faithful customers and hard-working staff. Although we no longer have pubs for you to visit and try our award-winning beers we encourage you to pick up a 6 pack of Workhorse IPA, Free Range Red, or one of our 16oz rotating seasonal beers. _______See what's available here_______, and _____Where to get it here____. We'll also have a special 25th anniversary beer available in mid-March. We're bringing back the first beer we ever canned!
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll also be sharing blasts from the past and highlights from our 25 years in business so stay tuned for some vintage stuff!
			</p>
			<p>Stay with us this year. _____Sign up for our newsletter____, follow us on all our socials to keep up with what we have happening this year.</p>
			<p>Cheers!</p>
