			<p className="text-2xl lg:text-4xl">Laurelwood Brewing Co. is a family-owned business founded in 2001 by the husband-and-wife team Mike De Kalb and Cathy Woo-De Kalb. After years of working in the
				hospitality industry and raising a family, Mike and Cathy made the leap to ownership.
				The original Laurelwood Public House &amp; Brewery was opened in the Hollywood district
				of Portland, Oregon in March of 2001, in what was a defunct pub with a 7-barrel
				brewery.
				<br />
				<br />
				Mike and Cathy opened Laurelwood Public House &amp; Brewery with the goal of creating a
				space where all could feel welcome. They wanted it to feel like a party at their house
				where moms, dads, kids, single friends, and neighbors could all mingle together – “A
				Place Where Friends and Families Meet.”
				<br />
				<br />
				Through the past 25 years, Laurelwood Brewing Co has endured many ups and downs.
				They opened multiple award-winning pubs, including locations at Portland International
				Airport and Moda Center. Over 500 delicious beers were brewed, and many were
				recognized in national competitions for their excellence. Friendships were forged,
				among ownership, staff and customers, many that will last a lifetime. But the COVID-19
				pandemic was tough. It changed the economy and restaurant business, and Mike and
				Cathy realized that it was time for Laurelwood to change as well.
				<br />
				<br />
				Laurelwood Brewing Co now is a distribution only Brewery. You can find our beer in
				12oz, 16oz and 19.2oz cans, and on draft at select locations throughout Oregon and
				SW Washington. Laurelwood partners with Bouy Beer in Astoria Oregon because they
				share our philosophy of producing handcrafted beer with quality ingredients.
				Laurelwood has a recipe collection of over 500 beers that have been produced
				throughout the years and Bouy Beer has been excited to bring these recipes back to
				life.
				<br />
				<br />
				Look for Laurelwood Brewing beers wherever better beer is sold.
				<br />
				<br />
				Cheers!
				<br />
				<br />
				Mike &amp; Cathy</p>
